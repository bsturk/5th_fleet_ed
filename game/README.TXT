NOTES TO THE PLAYER :

    o You will notice in each of the scenarios that one side or the other will
      start the game with victory points.  These points are awarded to the side
      prior to scenario initiation in order to enhance play balance of the
      scenario.  This is represented on the Victory Points display as the
      "Scenario Score Margin".

    o A highlighted hex in the game is represented with a white border.  In the
      manual it is represented with a dashed line to accent the fact that it is
      a highlighted hex.

    o When assigning movement orders, arrows will appear charting the route the
      unit will take when moving.  The movement order can be cancelled by
      pressing the ESCape key when the unit is highlighted.
